# HMT data sets

Complete releases of the Homer Multitext project's are available from hmt-archive repository in CEX format, but as the archive grows, it can be challenging to load an entire data release and extract a particular set of data to analyze.

This repository hosts a selection extracts from the HMT archive in simple, plain-text formats (delimited text, json), and the Scala scripts that were used to extract each data set from the archive.


## Data sets and their archival sources

| Data set | Summary | Source release | Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [data/hmt-scholia-xml.cex](./data/hmt-scholia-xml.cex) | Archival XML of all scholia in CEX format | `hmt-2020i` | Generated by hmt-archive in process of assembling a complete release |
| [data/persons-index.cex](./data/persons-index.cex)  | Index of passages in scholia to personal name identifiers | `hmt-2020i` | Build with [scripts/indexPNsInScholia.scala](scripts/indexPNsInScholia.scala)
