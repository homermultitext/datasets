# datasets

Complete releases of the Homer Multitext project's are available from hmt-archive repository in CEX format, but as the archive grows, it can be challenging to load an entire data release and extract a particular set of data to analyze.

This repository hosts a selection extracts from the HMT archive in simple, plain-text formats (delimited text, json), and the Scala scripts that were used to extract each data set from the archive.
